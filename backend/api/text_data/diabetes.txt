Diabetes mellitus, or simply diabetes, is a chronic disease affecting about 25.8 million people in the United States making it the seventh leading cause of death.
Diabetes is a metabolic disorder in which there are high levels of sugar in the blood, a condition called hyperglycemia. 
Under normal conditions, food is broken down to glucose which then enters the bloodstream and acts as fuel for the body. 
The pancreas produces a hormone called insulin which helps to carry glucose from the bloodstream into muscle, fat and liver where it can be used as fuel. 
Diabetics are not able to move this sugar out of the bloodstream because of two primary reasons: their pancreas does not produce enough insulin and/or their cells do not respond normally to insulin, a condition called insulin resistance. 
This is why people with diabetes have high blood sugar levels.
