# Safe AI - Your Healthcare Solution

Welcome to the Safe AI GitHub repository! Safe AI is a mobile application that uses generative AI to improve the efficiency of basic health centers,
strengthen healthcare delivery and increase access to medical services. This repository contains the source code of the Safe AI platform.

## Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `backend/`: This directory contains the backend code of the Safe AI platform, including the API endpoints, database models, and business logic implemented in Python using the Flask framework.
- `mobile/`: Here, you will find the mobile code for the Safe AI platform, implemented using JavaScript, React. This directory also includes all JavaScript files for the mobile application.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide a collaborative space for development and improvement of the Safe AI platform. By making the repository publicly accessible, we aim to foster community engagement, allowing developers, contributors, and users to explore the codebase, report issues, and suggest enhancements.

## How Generative AI Models are Solving the Problem
Safe AI Generative AI models is an mobile phone application that provide medical assistance, particularly in the domain of question answering (VQA). The chosen Generative AI models, such as the `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` and `deepset/roberta-base-squad2` models, have been fine-tuned to process and interpret texts containing the majority medical assistance knowledge from different websites and users questions. These models utilize tokenization and emdeddings techniques to create vectors which represent words and sentences meanings and semantics. 

By incorporating Generative AI models into Safe AI, we enable users to ask questions about medical advices and assistances, such as virus propagation,cure , or a lot of related topics about health, and receive relevant answers. This significantly helps people in need or in an emergency, and can help in reducing mortality rate. Moroever, Safe AI can be helpful for doctors for decision driving and diagnostic proces.
